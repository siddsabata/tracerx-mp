### finishing touches 
- [ ] in markers, fix up the output. add more details about the output 
  - explain method 1 (fraction optimization)
  - Method 2 Results (lam1=0, lam2=1) is tree structure optimization
    - you want to do this at the initial step
  - Method 2 Results (lam1=1, lam2=0) is fraction optimization
- [ ] clean up input directory inputs for slurm scripts
  - assume the directory is already created. the script should not be creating 
    the directory. the user should deal with this themselves. 
- [ ] up number of cpus on each task (i think most of them are at 1)
- [ ] rename files so they have more informative names 
- [ ] go through each file and fix the style so they follow Google coding standards
